<!-- # This challenge took me [1] hours. 

JS has a lot of built-in methods to access DOM elements and set or get values.
Unlike jquery however, it can get a bit wordy to do things. I see a lot of examples
that employ multiple lines to accomplish things, which to me seem to be possible
in fewer lines. I don't know if that's a function of just trying to show examples
in a simple fashion, or the relatively limited nature of DOM manipulation with 
plain JS. But having some exposure to jQuery, the process seems a bit more complicated.

With plain JS, we need to take care whether we're scanning for elements by ID or by class. 
In jQuery it doesn't matter ( $(".class") or $("#ID") -- the basic format is the same ). 
But JS has different method names depending on what we want to do. We can search by ID,
by ClassName, or even by TagName. After that, we can manipulate them as we wish.
The one trick I had to remember is that the latter two return an array of items, or a
nodeList. That means we have to unpack the nodeList in order to manipulate the 
individual elements.
