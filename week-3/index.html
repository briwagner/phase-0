I was comfortable working with HTML, as it's something I've done a few times before writing code for small web sites. I learned a few bew things in the lessons about HTML5 and validation. I know I have a bit to learn on the validation front. I hope I was a good partner.

The semantic HTML5 tags are new to me, so it's re-learning something again. I see huge value in using semantic tags, to distinguish from the endless 'div's that so often fill a site's code, bringing me to tears. I did not weep today.

As hard as it was, I refrained from styling the page. I love my stylesheets. But I bit my tongue to my partner's benefit. I have to down push the feelings that we didn't complete the challenge, because the web site is not actually cloned ... until we get that styling in!

HTML is great because it's conceptually very simple. HTML is weak because it's very simple. I like to think that HTML is something you apply to a document once it's all written and laid out. The tags can just float in to maintain the structure. It doesn't contort the document after the fact, and it doesn't really force you to foresee conditions that distract from putting the original document together. Maybe a food metaphor is good. The chef makes a wonderful entree, and it's lovely. I can add a small appetizer and dessert to the meal and frame it all very nicely. The additions don't distract from the entree, and likewise, without the entree, it's not a meal.
The weakness of HTML is that it requires other languages to do what may seem simple things.

I have developed muscle/brain memory for writing HTML tags. But I also have a few mnemonic devices for elements. Think 'list' for <li>. Think the 'A' in 'tag' for <a>. I'm sure I have a few others that I can't remember now, because I don't have mnemonic devices for remembering the mnemonic devices. In general, I try to separate thinking about the raw structure from thinking about the content. I find it easier to write all the tags for a section at once -- that way I tend not to forget to close tags, etc. And then go back and insert the specific content where it fits.
