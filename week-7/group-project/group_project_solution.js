As a user, I want to use a function called sum that will add up all the numbers
in a list, and give me the result.

As a user, I want to use a function called mean that will calculate the average
of all the numbers in a list.

As a user, I want to use a function called median that will calculate the median
of all the numbers in a list.
For a list with an odd-number of entries, the median is the middle number.
For a list with an even-number, the median is the average of the two numbers
closest to the middle.
